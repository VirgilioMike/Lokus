## Implementation Plan: Swagger/OpenAPI Specification Validator

This document outlines the implementation plan for creating a Swagger/OpenAPI Specification Validator tool. This plan is intended for a coding AI agent.

### 1. Project Overview

**Purpose:**

The primary goal of this tool is to validate Swagger/OpenAPI specification files (in YAML format) against a predefined set of rules. Specifically, it will check for the presence of forbidden keys that might represent sensitive information or lead to insecure API specifications. The tool aims to enhance security and maintain consistency in API documentation and development workflows.

**Target Language:** Python

**Key Features:**

*   Load a configuration file specifying forbidden keys.
*   Parse Swagger/OpenAPI YAML files.
*   Perform a deep search through all nested structures of the specification.
*   Report any instances of forbidden keys found, including their location (path) within the specification.
*   Exit with status code `0` if the validation passes (no forbidden keys found).
*   Exit with status code `1` if validation fails (forbidden keys are found).
*   Integrate seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines, with an initial focus on GitHub Actions.

### 2. TODO List for Implementation Plan Creation
